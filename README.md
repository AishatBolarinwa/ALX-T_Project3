## Dataset

> **Prosper Marketplace, Inc.** is a San Francisco, California-based company in the peer-to-peer lending industry. Prosper Funding LLC, one of its subsidiaries, operates Prosper.com, a website where individuals can either invest in personal loans or request to borrow money.
Prosper Marketplace is America's first peer-to-peer lending marketplace, with over seven billion dollars in funded loans. Borrowers request personal loans on Prosper and investors (individual or institutional) can fund anywhere from two thousand to forty thousand dollars per loan request. Investors can consider borrowersâ€™ credit scores, ratings, and histories and the category of the loan. Prosper handles the servicing of the loan and collects and distributes borrower payments and interest back to the loan investors.

> **Prosper Loan Data** : This [data set]('https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv') contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. This [data dictionary]('https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key%3D0AllIqIyvWZdadDd5NTlqZ1pBMHlsUjdrOTZHaVBuSlE%26usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1666072219001097&usg=AOvVaw01_FnjF4p7Oc8-HzrgArFd') explains the variables in the data set.



## Summary of Findings

> After exploring the dataset, it was found that more than half of the loan is still active, ie the borrowers are still running their loan term which is mostly a three year spanned loan and that **Debt consolidation** was the most common reason for taking loan. It was also found that the distribution of home owners is even, 53% of borrowers own a house. Majority of the borrowers come from California, New York, Texas and Florida and are either Professionals, Executives or belong to the 'Other' category of Occupation. Prosper score and Prosper rating is a good determinant of the borrower's rate, annual percentage rate (APR), lender's yield, loan amount etc.
